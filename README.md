# Jukebox

Welcome to Jukebox! This gem will list upcoming concerts in the Memphis area. You can select any concert that you'd like to know more about, and at any time you can view the list of concerts again.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jukebox-cli-app'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jukebox-cli-app

## Usage

1. Run the gem and a list of concerts in Memphis will automatically be displayed.
2. Type the number associated with the concert you'd like more information on.
3. Type "list" to return to the list of upcoming concerts.
4. Type "exit" when you are done viewing concerts.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
